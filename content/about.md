I am computer science graduate, with a keen interest in compilers, programming languages and functional programming.

I currently work at Google, Bangalore. At work, I mostly use Java and build APIs to automate and streamline Google's supplychain domain.

I found SICP and Clojure in my college, and ever since been interested in Lisps and functional programming.
